# Spotify Look and Play

This project was made to gain deeper understanding of React and Redux (with Hooks!), and CSS, specifically base CSS with no component libraries. Using the Spotify API, a user with a Spotify Account (premium or free), can look up their favorite songs, artists, or albums, and play them  with real-time playback information.
